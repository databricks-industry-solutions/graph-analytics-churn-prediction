# MAGIC This is a fairly clean dataset so we'll just do some one-hot encoding, and clean up the column names afterward.

# COMMAND ----------

from graphframes import *
from math import comb

# COMMAND ----------

catalog = "hive_metastore"
db_name = "telco"

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Read in Silver Delta table using Spark
# Read customer data into Spark
customer_df = spark.table(f"{catalog}.{db_name}.telco_churn_customers_silver")
display(customer_df)

# MAGIC ### Using Pandas on spark
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because our Data Scientist team is familiar with Pandas, we'll use `Pandas on spark` to scale `pandas` code. The Pandas instructions will be converted in the spark engine under the hood and distributed at scale.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note: Starting from `spark 3.2`, koalas is builtin and we can get an Pandas Dataframe using `pandas_api`.*

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once our features are ready, we'll save them in Databricks Feature Store. Under the hood, features store are backed by a Delta Lake table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This will allow discoverability and reusability of our feature accross our organization, increasing team efficiency.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Feature store will bring traceability and governance in our deployment, knowing which model is dependent of which set of features.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Make sure you're using the "Machine Learning" menu to have access to your feature store using the UI.

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient

fs = FeatureStoreClient()

try:
  #drop table if exists
  fs.drop_table(f"{catalog}.{db_name}.telco_churn_customer_features")

#Note: You might need to delete the FS table using the UI
